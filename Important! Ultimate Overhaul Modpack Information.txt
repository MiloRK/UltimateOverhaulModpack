Important:

I have heavily modified several of these mods for direct compatibility, balance, and even aesthetics, with Superior Crafting, please read the changelog for full details!

Pre-Installation:

    Delete all mods inside your mods folder except "core" this is not a mod it is the games core files.
    Go to:
        WINDOWS: C:/Users/username/AppData/LocalLow/Ludeon Studios/RimWorld
        MAC: Users/username/library/Caches/RimWorld
        LINUX: /home/username/.config/unity3d/Ludeon Studios/RimWorld
    Delete the Saves, Worlds, and Config folders
    Run the game once without any mods installed to make sure it is running properly, this will also generate a new config folder.
    Close the game to finish the pre-installation.


Note: On Windows, the AppData folder may be hidden. Solution: http://www.wikihow.com/Find-Hidden-Files-and-Folders-in-Windows

Installation:

    Using 7-zip unzip the Ultimate Overhaul Modpack directly into the mods folder.
    MAC users you can find your mod folder by right-clicking on your application --> Show Package Contents, the mods folder is in there.
    Unzip the ModsConfig.rar into your Config folder found here:

        MAC: Users/username/library/Caches/RimWorld/Config
